## Project Loop Harness

Claude Code should use `pcl` as the only state mutation interface for `.project-loop`.

Before acting:

1. Read `pcl.yaml`.
2. Run `pcl loop status` or `pcl next` when the next action is unclear.
3. Do not read, parse, or hand-edit generated dashboard HTML; it is a human-only view.
4. Use `pcl` JSON commands, reports, evidence paths, or `dashboard-data.json` for machine context.
5. Do not write raw SQL against `.project-loop/project.db`.
6. Use `pcl story` and `pcl test` for behavior-facing test-first work.
7. Preserve evidence paths for claims of completion.
